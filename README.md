E-waste 
Shredding: E-waste is shredded to separate materials
Magnetic separation: Ferrous metals like iron and steel are separated using magnets
Eddy currents: Non-ferrous metals are separated using eddy currents
Data sanitization: Data is rendered unusable or wiped out
Recycling: Materials are segregated and used to make new electronics

Collection: Collect the eco-waste 
Storage: Store the eco-waste 
Manual sorting: Manually sort the eco-waste to extract specific items, like batteries and bulbs 
Dismantling: Dismantle the eco-waste by hand to recover valuable materials or components 
Shredding: Shred the eco-waste into small pieces to prepare for further sorting 
Mechanical separation: Use a powerful overhead magnet to separate iron and steel from the waste stream 
Recovery: Recover the materials for reuse
